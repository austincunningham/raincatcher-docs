= Using the demo application user interface

The {WFM-RC-LongName} demo application consists of three components:

- A mobile application for end users
- A portal application for administrator users on a web browser
- A cloud application for backend server functionality (No user interface)

The demo application has demo users and demo data to show off the functionality of {WFM-RC-LongName}.
The demo application can define business process or procedure via a custome Workflow and assign these workflows as jobs to
individual workers as workorders. Workers can view their workorder via a mobile applicaion and administrators
can managed workorders via the web portal.
