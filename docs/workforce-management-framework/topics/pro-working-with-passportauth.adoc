== Configuration of PassportAuth module

As the PassportAuth module is the default provider of authentication and authorisation, it is already integrated 
with the Demo applications. It is an out of the box security solution for default integration using static 
JSON files as user source. The sample users and access roles are defined in a JSON file for Demo purposes in the 
link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/demo/data/src/users.json[Demo Data] To use different source please follow guide bellow. RainCatcher PassportAuth is a lightweight solution 
that offers all the functionality required to get started.

NOTE: _UserRepository_ requires user data containing a minimum of username and password to work.

. Implement the link:../../../raincatcher-docs/{WFM-RC-Api-Version}{WFM-RC-Api-User-Repository}[UserRepository].

For an end to end implementation of the _UserRepository_ interface, see link:{WFM-RC-Github-Core}{WFM-RC-Branch}{WFM-RC-PassportAuth-Example}[PassportAuth-Example].
