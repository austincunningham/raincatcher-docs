= Introducing the {WFM-RC-NameShort} Logger Module

The *{WFM-RC-NameLong} Logger Module* is a logging facade for link:https://nodejs.org[Node.js] based applications and it is used by all {WFM-RC-NameLong} modules.
The *{WFM-RC-NameLong} Logger Module* is contained in the `{WFM-RC-NameLong}-core` module.

Developers can use their own loggers by wrapping their implementation into the provided _logger interfaces_.
For more information about the _logger interface_ structure, see link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/logger/src/Logger.ts[Logger.ts] 

The {WFM-RC-NameLong} Demo application cotains two implementations of the _logger interface_ and are found in the `{WFM-RC-NameLong}-core` module.
To view an exmaple, see the link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/logger/example/index.ts[Cloud Logger] example.
