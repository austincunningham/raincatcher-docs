link:https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-core/tree/{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/passportauth[passportAuth] module.

{WFM-RC-NameShort} authentication and authorisation module using link:http://passportjs.org[PassportJS].
The Passport.js module is the default security module for {WFM-RC-NameShort}.

Passport provides pluggable authentication using link:http://passportjs.org/docs/configure[strategies].
Applications can choose which strategies to employ.
Passport.js offers comprehensive set of strategies that support authentication using a username and password, Facebook,
Twitter, and more.
This module allows:

- Access Control of Express routes
- Authorisation insures access to routes based on currently authenticated user and role.
- Authentication using the link:../../../raincatcher-docs/{WFM-RC-Api-Version}{WFM-RC-Api-Default-Strategy}[default strategy]
- Express session middleware using link:https://github.com/expressjs/session[express-session]


== Configuration of PassportAuth module
As the PassportAuth module is the default provider of authentication and authorisation, it is already integrated with
the Demo applications.
It is an out of the box security solution for default integration using static json files as user source.
The sample users and access roles are defined in a JSON file for Demo purposes in the
link:https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-core/blob/{WFM-RC-Branch}/demo/data/src/users.json[Demo Data]
To use different source please follow guide bellow.
{WFM-RC-NameShort}. Passport.js is a lightweight solution that offers all the
functionality required to get started.

== Implementing UserRepository

Passport.js requires developers to implement the link:../../../raincatcher-docs/{WFM-RC-Api-Version}{WFM-RC-Api-User-Repository}[UserRepository]
interface that will be used by framework to fetch user data. UserRepository requires that users data will contain at least
username and password.

For end to end implementation of the UserRepository interface please follow our example app:
link:{WFM-RC-Github-Core}{WFM-RC-Branch}{WFM-RC-PassportAuth-Example}[example]

== Strategy Customisation
The link:../../../raincatcher-docs/{WFM-RC-Api-Version}{WFM-RC-Api-Default-Strategy}[default strategy] for the PassportAuth
module implements the Passport.js local strategy. As a developer you may wish to
use a different security strategy with the passport.js implementation. You can override the
link:../../../raincatcher-docs/{WFM-RC-Api-Version}{WFM-RC-Api-Passport-Auth}[PassportAuth.setup] method to
implement any strategy supported by Passport.js.
